- after finishing a set work defined in a plan, always do the following
    - first, update the plan to reflect your progress
    - second, update the CHANGELOG.md to include the work just done
    - third, create a commit for the last phase
    - fourth, review the plan before continuing to the next phase
- all functions must be documented with a docstring
- all functions must have unit tests
- all mcp_tools must have integration tests
- all features must be documented
    - `./docs/project-knowledge/dev/` contains
        - implementation details
        - ADRs
        - possible future work and feature gaps
    - `./docs/project-knowledge/user/` contains
        - usage details
        - configuration examples
        - limitations and considerations
- Plans
  - Locations:
    - Plans: `.ai/plans/<plan_name>.md`
    - Phases: `.ai/plans/phases/<plan_name>.phase-<phase_number>.md`
  - Plan phases exist as individual markdown documents.
  - Plan Lifecycle
    - Creation
      - Determine if the work should extend an existing plan or start a new one
      - Update the INDEX.md to include the Plan, and component phases
  - Phase Lifecycle
    - Start
      - Update the status in the phase & plan documents
    - Complete
      - Update the status in the phase & plan documents
- the project INDEX is located at `.ai/INDEX.md`
- When new work is started, determine if the work should extend an existing plan or start a new one
- linter configs in root or `.ci/configs/` when tool supports it
- all markdown documents must have YAML frontmatter
    - required fields: id, title, status, date, author
    - id format: UUID v4 (uppercase with hyphens)
    - status format: emoji prefix + status text (e.g., "✅ Completed")
    - date format: YYYY-MM-DD
    - optional fields: related (array of UUIDs), children (array of UUIDs)
    - see docs/project-knowledge/dev/adr-frontmatter-standard.md for complete specification
- when creating new markdown documents
    - generate UUID with `uuidgen` or `.ai/scripts/generate-uuid.sh`
    - add frontmatter block at top of file
    - link to related documents via `related` field (bidirectional)
    - if document has child documents, list in `children` field
- when referencing documents
    - prefer UUID-based references over file paths
    - maintain bidirectional links (if A relates to B, B should relate to A)
